title: "Visualising radiation from accelerating charges"

When a charged particle, say an electron, wiggles around it emits radiation, specifically electro-magnetic radiation which includes things like radio-waves and visible light.
Althought the mathmatics to describe this can be quite complicated, I think it can be visualised by just thinking about what happens when an object undegoes some form of acceleration.
The information about this acceleration propagates outwards, but only at a limited speed as described by special relativity.
One type of information is the attractive or repulsive force experienced by a charged particle due to the presence of another charged particle.
So if an observer was able to measure the force experienced by a slightly postively charged particle she was carrying in a special container, due to an electron some distance away, she could tell the direction of that electron by the direction of the force.
But because the information is delayed, she would actaully measure where the electron was some small time earlier.
Thats no problem if the electron of interest is just sitting there, but if it starts moving around then it is going to get interesting.

A classic example is a dipole, where the electron performs a periodic oscillation.
In the visualisation below, the information about the electrons position is represented by expanding blue circles, originating from the electron at certain intervals.
Red lines connect up points at the same angular position on each circle.
