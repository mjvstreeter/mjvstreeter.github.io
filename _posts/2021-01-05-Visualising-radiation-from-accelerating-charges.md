When a charged particle, say an electron, wiggles around it emits radiation, specifically electro-magnetic radiation which includes things like radio-waves and visible light.
This can be visualised by considering what happens when an object undegoes some form of acceleration.
The information about this acceleration propagates outwards, but only at a limited speed as described by special relativity.
One type of information is the attractive or repulsive force experienced by a charged particle due to the presence of another charged particle.
So if an observer was able to measure the force experienced by a slightly postively charged particle she was carrying in a special container, due to an electron some distance away, she could tell the direction of that electron by the direction of the force.
But because the information is delayed, she would actaully measure where the electron was some small time earlier.
Thats no problem if the electron of interest is just sitting there, but if it starts moving around then it is going to get interesting.

A classic example is a dipole, where the electron performs a periodic oscillation.
In the visualisation below, the information about the electron's position is represented by expanding blue circles, originating from the electron at certain intervals.
The red lines connect points moving away from the charge at the speed of light and at a fixed angle.
These lines can be thought of as the electric field lines resulting from the charge of the electron.

As the electron starts to move, wiggles form in the field lines, which then propagate outwards at the speed of light.
The transverse periodic wiggles in the field line, which are seen along mainly to the left and right of the dipole, actually carry energy away from the dipole in the form of electro-magnetic radiation.
So this dipole is a source of light, and can be seen through a purely geometric approach and by knowing that a charged particle generates a radial electric field.
